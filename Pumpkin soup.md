- Olive Oil
- About 2 pounds of pumpkin (or squash?)
- 2 Medium size onions
- 700ml of vegetable stock
- 150ml of double cream
- Cinnanmon, Ginger, and Salt to taste

-----

Chop the onions. Cut up the pumpkin and discard any seeds or strings. Peel the chunks.

In the soup pan, sautee the onions until they just start to get browned. Add the vegetable stock and pumpkin. Cover and put on medium heat. 

Stir the pumpkin around every 15min or so until it shrinks and softens. 

When the pumpkin is soft enough to squish with a spoon, scoop out the pieces into a blender and puree. Return to pan. It took me about 3 runs of the blender. Then I added a cup or so of water and ran the blender just to pick up all the spare pumpkin puree left in the glass.

Add spices to taste. Salt varies depending on the type of stock used. Add ginger for a spicier variant. Cinnamon for a nice taste of fall.

This soup pairs really well with a dry crouton to drop in. The recipe at http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/7730/pumpkin-soup also recommends pumpkin seeds or pine nuts sprinkled on top.

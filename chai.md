### Chai

**untested**

- Add 3/4" crushed Ginger and 2 tea spoons
  tea powder to 1 cup of water to the pot.

- Bring to boil

- Once the mixture is boiling, add in the milk.
  Continue heating till the mixture with milk just starts boiling.

- Pour the tea into serving cups through a strainer that catches
  everything but the liquid.

And sip through sitting in the veranda while the rains pour!

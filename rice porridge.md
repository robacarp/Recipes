RICE PORRIDGE (OKAYU)
 
Simple and easy homemade Japanese rice porridge recipe. All you need is water and rice. Garnish with scallions, salted salmon, and nori, this homey, comforting dish will sure to keep you nourished and the chill at bay. 

### INGREDIENTS


¼ cup uncooked Japanese short grain rice (¼ cup = 50 g)
250 ml water
Toppings of your choice:
Shredded Japanese Salted Salmon
Umeboshi (Japanese pickled plum)
green onion/scallion Chopped
shredded nori seaweed (kizami nori)
white sesame seeds (roasted/toasted)
Mitsuba (Japanese parsley) (for garnish)

### INSTRUCTIONS

Rinse the rice in water, then drain. Repeat until the water runs clear.

Soak the rice in the pot for at least 30 minutes.

After 30 minutes, drain water completely. Then add 250 ml of water into the pot.

Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat.

When boiling, lower the heat to the stove’s lowest setting (make sure to use the right size of stove burner for your pot size). Open the lid and gently mix with the spoon once, making sure rice is not stuck to the bottom of the pot.

Cover the lid (See Note 2) and simmer the rice for 30 minutes. During this time, I never open the lid or mix the rice (See Note 3).

After 30 minutes, turn off the heat and let it steam for 10 minutes. The rice should be soft and thickened. If you want to add something, like a beaten egg or salt, this is the time to add. Today I didn’t add anything and kept it simple. Serve into individual rice bowl and garnish and put toppings of your choice.


### RECIPE NOTES

1. With the heavy bottomed pot, the heat is not as direct or strong as regular pot, so you can cook rice evenly.
2. I follow 1 to 5 rice-to-water ratio for my Okayu recipe. With good size pot, and the lowest heat on the stove, water should not boil over. If you cook with more water or your pot is smaller than my pot, you may want to cover the lid at a slight angle so the water doesn’t boil over.
3. If you are worried, you can quickly peek and make sure there’s enough water so the rice doesn’t burn the bottom of the pot. If necessary, you can stir the pot or add "hot" water. Otherwise, don’t touch the rice because you would end up breaking the nice shape of rice kernels.


Rice-Water Ratio
Zen-gayu – 1 : 5 (50 grams : 250 ml)
Shichibu-gayu – 1 : 7 (50 grams : 350 ml)
Gobu-gayu – 1 :10 (50 grams : 500 ml)
Sanbu-gayu – 1 : 20 (25 grams : 500 ml)


Using Cooked Rice
Add rice and 2-3 times water in the pot. Cook stirring over medium low heat. Adjust the consistency by adding more water.

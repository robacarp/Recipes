Happy Snowy Saturday,

Several of you have asked for my White Chicken Chili I made at the cook off and I thought this was a good day to send it! (I also am finally getting around to it)

Ingredients:
- 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (14.5 oz) cans chicken broth
- 1 (4 oz) can diced green chilies
- 1 1/2 tsp cumin
- 3/4 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp ground coriander
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 (8 oz) pkg light cream cheese
- 1 1/4 cup fresh corn (frozen works too)
- 3 (15 oz) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup green tomatillo salsa

Toppings
- fresh lime wedges
- chopped fresh cilantro
- shredded Monterrey Jack cheese
- tortilla chips

Directions:
- Heat chicken, olive oil and garlic on med-high in a large soup pot
- When chicken is mostly cooked, add diced onions and about 2tbs of broth. Cook until onions are mostly translucent and chicken is done.
- Add broth, green chillies, corn, 2 of the 3 cans of beans (beans should be rinsed and drained) and all of the spices. Turn the heat down to a medium simmer.
- In a food processor or blender, mix the cream cheese, green tomatillo salsa and one can of (rinsed & drained) cannelloni beans. Add more green salsa as desired until mixture is smooth.
- Add the mixture to the soup pot and continue to simmer for at least 15 mins.

Serve hot with generous amounts of toppings!
Enjoy and stay warm this weekend!

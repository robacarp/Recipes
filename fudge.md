##Notes

####Ingredients

The ratio of marshmallow cream to chocolate chips is the key to making different sorts of fudges. When made as stated, with 14oz cream and 12oz chips, the fudge is light in color and very sweet. When made with 7oz cream and 18oz chocolate, the fudge is slightly darker in color and has a more noticable chocolate taste.

####Cooking the sugar

Temperature should reach about 112ºC but it isn't absolutely necessary.  Because you're mixing in butter with the sugar, it will cook easier but it can also create caramel nuggets. I Check the granule size of the sugar periodically by dripping some syrup off of a spatula, blowing to cool off the remnants stuck to the spatula, and then dabbing a finger into the remnants on the spatula to check the texture with your tongue. After it starts to boil, it might still *look* like it would taste "sandy" due to tiny bubbles in the syrup. 

####Mixing the goods

After the mixture becomes homogenous, I dab a fork in and taste the mix. It is still warm enough that you can add things to balance the flavor and mix again. 

Keep mixing until it thickens considerably.

I had a hard time getting the sugar to reach the desired temperature.  Since I'm at altitude, I was targeting ~110ºC. At about 107ºC it started making a bunch of caramel bubbles in the mix. At that point I poured off the good parts of the stuff into the chocolate and finished it.  It turned out fine, though a few people were surprised by a small caramel chip in their square.

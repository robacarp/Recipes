##Notes

####Ingredients

The ratio of marshmallow cream to chocolate chips is the key to making different sorts of fudges. When made as stated, with 14oz cream and 12oz chips, the fudge is the light in chocolate and very sweet. When made with 7oz cream and 18oz chocolate, the fudge is darker in color and has a more noticable chocolate taste.

####Cooking the sugar

Temperature should reach about 234F but it isn't absolutely necessary. Check the granule size of the sugar periodically by dripping some syrup off of a spatula, blowing to cool off the remnants stuck to the spatula, and then dabbing a finger into the remnants on the spatula to check the texture with your tongue. After it starts to boil, it might still *look* like it would taste "sandy" due to tiny bubbles in the syrup. Orally checking the texture is key. Not burning yourself is also key.

####Mixing the goods

After the mixture becomes homogenous, I dab a fork in and taste the mix. It is still warm enough that you can add things to balance the flavor and mix again.

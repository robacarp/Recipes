## Ingredients

#### Dough
- 13oz Water
- 1 pkg. Active Dry Yeast
- 2Tsp. Light Brown Sugar
- 4Tbsp Butter, soft
- 4 1/3C Bread / All purpose flour
- 1/4C Rye Flour
- 1 3/4 Tsp Salt

#### Solution
- 2C Baking Soda

#### Also needed

### Pretzel Prep
1. Preheat oven to 275ºF (to cure soda)
2. Power mixer: combine all ingredients for dough in mixing bowl.  Mix on low for 8 min, add water or flour as needed.  **Hand mixing**: Combine ingredients with wooden spoon. When dough becomes a bulk, transfer to work surface and knead for ~10min. Add flour or water as needed.
3. Cover dough with plastic and let it rest for 15min.
4. Press dough into rectangle, then divide into 8 peices.
5. Shape each piece into a tight cylinder, cover with plastic, and let rest for 10min.
6. Roll dough into ~3ft strands with fat centers. Add water to work surface to make it sticky enough to roll out the dough.
7. Shape into pretzel knots.
8. Place pretzels on baking sheets lined with dish towels and cover with towels. Let sit for 30min.
9. Refrigerate to firm up dough for 45min, up to 5hours.

### Dipping Solution Prep
1. Line baking pan with aluminum foil and spread baking soda on it. 
2. Bake for 1 hour at 275ºF.
3. Dissolve soda in water: 2/3C Water : 2C **cool** water.
4. Set oven to 450ºF (for baking pretzels)

### The Magic
1. Remove pretzels from baking pan, line pan with parchment paper. Lightly coat with nonstick spray.
2. Dip pretzel in solution for 30 sec, transfer to lined pan.
3. Cut along the thick part of the pretzel (at the bottom) with a knife to spread it.
4. Sprinkle pretzel with salt.
5. Bake for 12-15min or until deep brown.

## Further Notes
From the original recipe: 
>Pretzels are best eaten the day they're prepared. Don't store pretzels tightly wrapped or the salt will evaporate. Leftovers can be refreshed the next day by placing them in a toaster oven until warm or in microwave for about 15 seconds.
>If you prepared more of the baking soda than used, you can simply store it in an airtight container until next time.

INGREDIENTS


- 2 pounds beef chuck roast
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 ounces butter
- 4 green onions, sliced (white parts only)
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth
- 1 teaspoon prepared mustard
- 1 (6 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
- 1/3 cup sour cream
- 1/3 cup white wine
- salt to taste
- ground black pepper to taste


DIRECTIONS


1. Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/2 inch thick by 2 inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and pepper.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and brown the beef strips quickly, then push the beef strips off to one side. Add the onions and cook slowly for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with the beef strips.
3. Stir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in mustard. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.
4. Five minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and white wine. Heat briefly then salt and pepper to taste.

I have made this stroganoff several times and it has become a staple! My boyfriend (now husband 7/2006) claims this is his all time favorite dish that I make. 

Over time I have made several modifications to this recipe: 
1. Marinate the meat in red or white wine for 1-2 hours in the fridge prior to cooking. This adds a really nice flavor to the beef and tenderizes the meat, and you can skip the addition of the wine at the end as this can thin out the sauce. 
2. Use 1 medium yellow onion (sliced or chopped) instead of the green onions. 
3. Garlic is a must! 
4. Corn starch works just as well as flour or you can also use 2 tbsp of each...I have always found it easier to dissolve them in couple of tbsp of beef broth before adding it to the skillet otherwise it's really difficult to dissolve flour/corn starch in sauce. 
5. Add 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce along with the prepared mustard. 
6. Add two cans (4 oz cans) of sliced mushrooms halfway through simmering. 
7. Add 1/3 cup cream cheese and 1/3 cup sour cream that the end...trust me this key!!! 

TIP: I found it VERY difficult to push aside the browned meat and then cook the onions and add the flour to the skillet the first couple of times I made this. Instead, now I plate out the meat after browning and then cook the onions by itself in the pan, and then return the meat back to the pan and add broth with dissolved flour/starch.

### Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups warm water
- 2 ¼ tsp yeast (one packet)
- 2 ¼ tsp Kosher salt
- 3 ¼ cups unbleached flour (bread flour works best here)

### Prep

1. Mix the water, salt and yeast
2. Add in the flour and mix well, but not too vigorously. You should end up with a pretty wet dough.
4. Transfer the dough to a container and let it rise for two hours, or until it’s flattens off on top.
5. Store in the refrigerator until ready for use.

### Baking

1. Spread cornmeal on a wooden peel.
2. Lightly dust the top of the dough with flour and rip off about half.
3. Form a ball with the dough by pushing outward on top, inward on the bottom, and rotating about a quarter turn each time.
4. Once the ball is done, let it rest on the peel for 60 minutes or so.
5. After 40 minutes, turn the oven on to 450. Place a roasting pan below the baking stone and let it heat up as well.
6. Let the oven heat for a total of 20 minutes–it won’t make it to the full 450.
7. Liberally dust the top of the dough with flour, and make a few cuts into it using a serrated knife (this method is called “dust and slash”)
8. Slide the dough from the peel onto the baking stone
9. Pour one cup of very hot water into the pan.
10. Let the bread bake for 30-35 minutes, or until fully (and dark) browned.
11. Remove from oven and let cool. 
12. Nom away!

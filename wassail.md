### Wassail

I don't know what wassailing is or what wassail is supposed to taste like, but this is good and simple. I originally found it on a coaster.

- 4-5 C Apple Juice
- 4-5 Apples, peeled and sliced.
- 1/2 tsp Cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp Nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp Cloves (ground) or 1 tbsp whole Cloves
- dash Ginger
- garnish whole Cinnamon Sticks
- optional Spiced Rum

Mix all ingredients together over medium-low heat. Stir at least until spices are dissolved.

Serve by ladeling into mugs. If adding rum, 1 shot per mug makes a strong drink.

8 Lemons  (Sub any citrus fruit)
Lots of Sugar
Chocolate

Use a peeler to remove the peel from your fruit, and then trim with a knife.
It is best when they are thin and long strips.

Put all the peels in a pot and cover with water.  Bring to a boil for ~2 minutes,
drain.  This should remove the bitter.

Measure out enough water to cover the peels again.  Add equal amount of sugar and
boil for ~30min or until peel just starts to turn clear.  Remove from pot and dry
in an oven on parchment or wax paper.  About 300F for 25-30 min.  Taste test for
crispiness or chewyness.

Melt dipping chocolate (70% dark works well) and dip.  Put back on parchment/wax and cool.  Refrigerate/freeze because you're probably in a hurry. :-)

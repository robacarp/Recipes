### Eggnog (untested)

The venerable. I found this recipe on a coaster.

- 4 eggs, separated
- 1/3 C, 1 tbsp Sugar
- 1 Pint Whole Milk
- 1 C Heavy Cream
- 1 tsp grated nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp vanilla

Beat egg yolks. Slowly add 1/3 C Sugar, beat until sugar dissolves. Add Whole Milk, Heavy Cream, Nutmeg, Vanilla. Stir.

Separately, beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Slowly add 1 tbsp sugar and beat to stiff peaks.

Whisk egg whites into yolk mixture.

Chill overnight before serving.
